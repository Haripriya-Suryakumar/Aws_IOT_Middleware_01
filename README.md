# Aws_IOT_Middleware_01
The project involves designing and implementing a scalable IoT middleware solution using AWS IoT Core, Timestream, and QuickSight for real-time asset tracking and telemetry data visualization.
Project Description
This solution ingests device telemetry data via AWS IoT Core, stores it in Timestream, and visualizes the data in QuickSight for real-time monitoring and analysis. The architecture supports high-volume time-series data from IoT devices with millisecond-level resolution.

Architecture Components
Data Ingestion: AWS IoT Core (MQTT broker)

Data Storage: Amazon Timestream (time-series database)

Data Visualization: Amazon QuickSight (BI dashboard)
